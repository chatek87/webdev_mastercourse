'use strict';

/*
Best Practices

1. Add 'use strict'; to the tpo of every file and IIFE
2. Do not use var - use let or const instead. Prefer const.
    But use let if/when type needs to change.
3. Naming - use camelCase for variables, functions, etc.
          - use PascalCase for classes
4. Use IIFE's whenver it makes sense - it almost always akes sense
5. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
6. Use a separate file for your JavaScript.
7. Use semi-colons;
8. Don't Assume.
